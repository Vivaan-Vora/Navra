# Navra

## Overview

Navra is a warehouse navigation intelligence simulator built for both 2D grid navigation and 3D voxel navigation. It combines classical planning and reinforcement learning so teams can test route quality, reliability, and failure behavior under realistic warehouse constraints.

Navigation is often the biggest failure point in warehouse automation. When paths break due to floor changes, operations lose throughput and teams are forced into manual intervention. Navra addresses this with a simulation-first workflow so teams can validate behavior before live deployment.

The project is implemented in **Python** and uses **NumPy** for numerical processing, **PyTorch** for deep Q-network training, and **Matplotlib** for 2D and 3D visualizations.

## Core Capabilities

- 2D environment generation with moving obstacles and difficulty control
- 3D voxel environment generation with connectivity validation
- 2D and 3D sensor simulation modules
- Baseline pathfinding in both dimensions (BFS, Dijkstra, A*)
- Q-learning and DQN training support
- Logging, diagnostics, scoring, failure analysis, and benchmark tools

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --mode astar --difficulty medium
python main.py --mode train-q --episodes 100
```

## Pipeline

Navra supports a unified workflow for both 2D and 3D navigation experiments.

1. Generate a valid 2D or 3D warehouse layout.
2. Simulate observations from the relevant sensor module.
3. Run pathfinding and/or learning agents.
4. Log reward, stability, health, and failure metrics.
5. Analyze outputs with plots, leaderboards, and diagnostics reports.

## Configuration

The Navra `config.json` file includes settings for both environment types, training hyperparameters, diagnostics thresholds, navigation scoring weights, and output paths.

For 3D, `environment_3d` controls voxel size, difficulty, and moving obstacle count.
